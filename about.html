                  <h4 class="card-title">Hi! I am Haoheng Tang. </h4>
                  <p>With a background in architecture and interaction design, I have experience in fabrication at various scales. During my undergraduate years, I was engaged in a timber-structured pavilion design and construction project. I was also in the famous class Transformable Design Methods last fall, in which I worked with my teammate to parametrically design a timber-structured transformable kiosk. We fabricated and assembled it within a week. It turned out that the kinetic structure worked functionally well and had a lot of potential for public use. </p>
                  <p>In addition to architecture-scale projects, I have also worked on fabrication at the product scale. For example, in the class Interaction Intelligence last semester, I created interactive game devices utilizing various techniques including 3D printing, metal sheet laser cutting, powder coating, Arduino prototyping, and soldering. I have undertaken numerous other projects employing these same skills, one of which is Treeâ€™s Breath.</small></p>
                  <p>As I learned to code, I discovered the exhilarating ability to bring to life app demos that were once only concepts in my mind. What amplifies this excitement even further is the prospect of creating physical prototypes that were once only sketched on paper and engaging with them in the real world. This fascination fuels my eagerness to acquire any skill necessary to make this vision a reality. It's akin to embodying the spirit of Iron Man! Additionally, it marks a groundbreaking shift for designers. With digital fabrication technologies, designers are empowered to transform their imaginative designs into tangible creations by themselves. Imagine how excited Leonardo Da Vinci would be if he could make his visionary flying machine come true! I am committed to uniting my expertise in artificial intelligence with advanced fabrication skills to craft compelling interactive projects, giving life to the most cutting-edge technologies, which is embodied in my project A Mystery for You, an interactive device that is connected to GPT3.5 in real-time. </p>
